# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Reflection on Debugging:

1. This time around the first step I took was to look over read the code and get a bit familiar then ran my spec files. From there pulled up each of the 3 spec files that had failing tests and also split screened with the lib files. From there I worked from the bottom up from the list of tests. Felt it was easier to start with debugging one test then moving to two then three until I was fully passing. 

2. I think the hardest thing I found working on code I didnt write was trying to understand what the original author was trying to do with some of the code and navigating is test files. I was a bit confused at first with the added describe line with every test which is something I have not done. 

3. I feel like it was because I've seen and worked this before I got though debugging some much easier. I was able to read the errors so much better and understand where the error was happening and what is was wanting.
